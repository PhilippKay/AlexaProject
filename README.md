Alexa is the cloud-based “intelligent personal assistant” which processes your requests and supplies answers back through Echo. Alexa is fairly recent in German market (launched in Sept '16) and has great potential for developers to come up with use cases. Our mission is to make use of natural language processing in order to build custom Alexa skill.
